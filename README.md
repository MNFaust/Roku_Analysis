#Roku Log Analysis 
This is an ongoing project that I am making public. The inital purpose of this reasearch is to review PiHole Logs associated with a Roku's logging activity.
Takes PiHole logs generated on a PiHole machine and parses out all Roku genereated traffic that's resident within the logs. The promary purpose is  
to determine the amount of data a Roku is generating and how much of that data is non-streaming information being sent back to the Roku logging servers.
